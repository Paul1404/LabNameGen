2. **Select Location**: Choose the location from the dropdown (e.g., `HLDCA`, `CDCB`).
3. **Choose VMware Product or OS + Hypervisor**: Select a VMware product (e.g., vCenter, ESXi) or configure your OS and hypervisor manually.
4. **Generate**: Click `Generate Hostname` to see your dynamically generated hostname.

üß© How It Works
---------------

The application dynamically adjusts based on user input. For example:

* If a VMware product like **vCenter Appliance** is selected, OS and Hypervisor fields are hidden to avoid redundancy.
    
* Hostnames are generated in the format:
    
    ```php-template
    <location>-<product/hypervisor>-<os>-<last-two-octets>
    ```
    

The `CleanHostname()` function ensures all hostnames follow best practices (lowercase, limited special characters, length ‚â§ 63 characters).
